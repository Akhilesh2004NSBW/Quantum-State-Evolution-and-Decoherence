# Quantum State Evolution and Decoherence Simulation

A final year project for the **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** program at **Amrapali University, Haldwani**.

This project focuses on **simulating the fundamental principles of quantum computing**, specifically the **evolution of quantum states** and the **effects of environmental noise (decoherence)** on these states.  
Using **Python** and the **QuTiP library**, the simulation visualizes how quantum information degrades under different noise models, highlighting one of the core challenges in building **reliable quantum hardware**.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Qubit State Simulation:** Simulates and visualizes basic qubit states in an ideal, noise-free environment.
- **Noise Modeling:** Implements quantum noise channels such as:
  - Bit-flip  
  - Phase-flip  
  - Amplitude damping
- **Decoherence Visualization:** Compares noise-free and noisy state behaviors using:
  - Bloch Sphere  
  - Graphs and plots for detailed insights
- **Educational Tool:** Helps learners and researchers understand:
  - Quantum noise  
  - Quantum error correction  
  - Real-world challenges in quantum computing
