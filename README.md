# Quantum State Evolution and Decoherence Simulation

A final year project for the **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** program at **Amrapali University, Haldwani**.

This project focuses on **simulating the fundamental principles of quantum computing**, specifically the **evolution of quantum states** and the **effects of environmental noise (decoherence)** on these states.
Using **Python** and the **QuTiP library**, the simulation visualizes how quantum information degrades under different noise models, highlighting one of the core challenges in building **reliable quantum hardware**.
